<!-- 
1. map()
Exercise:
You have an array of numbers:
const numbers = [1, 4, 9, 16];
Use map() to get the square roots of these numbers.


2. filter()
Exercise:
You have an array of numbers:
const numbers = [5, 12, 8, 130, 44];
Use filter() to get all numbers greater than 10.


3. reduce()
Exercise:
You have an array of numbers:
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
Use reduce() to calculate the product of all numbers (multiply them all together)


4. forEach()
Exercise:
You have an array of names:
const names = [“Anna”, “Ben”, “Charlie”];
Use forEach() to log a message for each name: “Hello, [name]!”


5. find()
Exercise:
You have an array of objects:
const users = [
{ name: “Alice”, age: 22 },
{ name: “Bob”, age: 25 },
{ name: “Charlie”, age: 30 }
];
Use find() to get the user whose age is 25.


6. every()
Exercise:
You have an array of numbers:
const numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8];
Use every() to check if all numbers are even.


7. some()
Exercise:
You have an array of tasks:
const tasks = [
{ title: “Do homework”, done: false },
{ title: “Clean room”, done: true }
];
Use some() to check if at least one task is not done.


8. sort()
Exercise:
You have an array of numbers:
const numbers = [40, 100, 1, 5, 25, 10];
Use sort() to sort the numbers in ascending order. -->


<!-- 1. Chain map, filter, and reduce
You have an array of numbers:
const numbers = [5, 12, 8, 130, 44, 3, 10];
First, use filter() to keep only numbers greater than 10.
Then, use map() to multiply each of these numbers by 2.
Finally, use reduce() to find the sum of the resulting numbers.

2. Sort objects by multiple criteria
You have an array of people:
const people = [
{ name: “Alice”, age: 25 },
{ name: “Bob”, age: 30 },
{ name: “Charlie”, age: 25 },
{ name: “David”, age: 20 }
];
Sort this array first by age in ascending order, and if two people have the same age, sort them by name alphabetically.

3. Find unique values from two arrays
You have two arrays:
const arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const arr2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8];
Create a new array containing only values that are unique (appear in only one of the two arrays, not in both).

4. Check if all users have emails and at least one user is an admin
You have an array of users:
const users = [
{ name: “Alice”, email: “alice@mail.com”, role: “user” },
{ name: “Bob”, email: “bob@mail.com”, role: “admin” },
{ name: “Charlie”, email: “charlie@mail.com”, role: “user” }
];
Use every() to check if every user has an email.
Use some() to check if at least one user has the role “admin”.

5. Group items by a property
You have an array of products:
const products = [
{ name: “Apple”, category: “fruit” },
{ name: “Banana”, category: “fruit” },
{ name: “Carrot”, category: “vegetable” },
{ name: “Cucumber”, category: “vegetable” }
];
Write a function that groups products by category and returns an object like this:
{
fruit: [“Apple”, “Banana”],
vegetable: [“Carrot”, “Cucumber”]
}
