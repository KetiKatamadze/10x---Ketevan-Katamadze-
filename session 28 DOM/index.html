<!-- Case #1: The Hidden Message
Scenario: A crucial message was hidden in a webpage by Agent X before they disappeared. The message is stored in an invisible element.

Task:
- Select an element with ID 'hidden-message' using getElementById
- Make it visible by changing its style properties
- Read and decode the message (reverse the text) using string manipulation
- Display the decoded message in another element with ID 'decoded-message' -->
<section class="margin">
    <p id="hidden-message" style="display: none;">!egassem terces a si sihT</p>
    <p>Decoded Message: <span id="decoded-message"></span></p>
    <button onclick="revealMessage()">Reveal Message</button>
</section>


<!-- Case #2: Classified Files
Scenario: You've gained access to a digital filing cabinet with classified documents, but they're organized by different security levels.

Task:
- Select all elements with class 'classified-document' using getElementsByClassName
- Filter them based on their 'security-level' attribute
- Change the background color of 'high' security documents to red, 'medium' to yellow, and 'low' to green
- Add a click event to each document that reveals its contents when clicked -->
<section class="margin">
    <div class="classified" data-security="high">Top Secret Document</div>
    <div class="classified" data-security="medium">Confidential Report</div>
    <div class="classified" data-security="low">Public Notice</div>
</section>


<!-- 
Case #3: Suspect Identification
Scenario: We need to identify a cyber criminal from a digital lineup. The suspect has left traces in the HTML.

Task:
- Select all elements with tag name 'suspect' using getElementsByTagName
- Check each suspect's data attributes for clues
- When a clue matches your evidence (provided in a variable), mark that suspect by adding a 'prime-suspect' class
- Create a new element showing 'IDENTIFIED' and append it after the prime suspect -->
<section class="margin">
    <div class="suspect" data-clue="red-hat">Suspect 1</div>
    <div class="suspect" data-clue="blue-scarf">Suspect 2</div>
    <div class="suspect" data-clue="green-coat">Suspect 3</div>
</section>



<!-- Case #4: Digital Evidence Collection
Scenario: You need to collect digital evidence scattered throughout a webpage.

Task:
- Use querySelectorAll to select all elements with the attribute data-evidence='true'
- For each piece of evidence, create a new list item in an 'evidence-log' unordered list
- Add an event that lets you mark evidence as 'collected' when clicked
- Update a counter showing how many pieces of evidence remain -->
<section class="margin">
    <ul id="evidence-log"></ul>
    <p>Evidence Remaining: <span id="evidence-count">0</span></p>
    
    <div data-evidence="true">USB Drive</div>
    <div data-evidence="true">Hacked File</div>
    <div data-evidence="true">Suspicious Email</div>
</section>

<!-- Case #5: The Disappearing Records
Scenario: A hacker is deleting important information from a database interface. You need to create a system to monitor and recover the data.

Task:
- Create a form that allows adding new data entries to a table
- Implement 'delete' buttons for each entry that remove them from the DOM
- Create an 'audit log' that records each addition and deletion action
- Add a 'recover' feature that can restore accidentally deleted entries
- Use event delegation for efficiently handling all delete/recover actions -->

<section class="margin">
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Data Entry</th>
          <th>Actions</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody id="records">
        <tr>
          <td>Classified Info</td>
          <td><button onclick="deleteEntry(this)">Delete</button></td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    
    <button id="recoverButton" onclick="recoverLast()">Recover Last Deleted</button>
    <ul id="audit-log"></ul>
