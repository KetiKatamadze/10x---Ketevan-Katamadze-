 <!-- Task 2: Find Maximum Value (For...of Loop)
Story:
You’re a treasure hunter searching for the most valuable gem in a cave. The gems are stored in an array, and you need to find the one with the highest value. Use a for...of loop to solve this.
Instructions:
Write a function findMaxValue(numbers) that finds the maximum value in an array using a for...of loop.
Example:
findMaxValue([10, 20, 5, 30]); // Output: 30

 -->

 <!-- Task 3: Reverse a String (While Loop)
Story:
You’re a spy decoding a secret message. The message is encrypted in reverse, and you need to use a while loop to decode it.
Instructions:
Write a function reverseString(str) that reverses a string using a while loop.
Example:
reverseString("Hello"); // Output: olleH
 -->

 <!-- Task 4: Validate User Input (Do...While Loop)
Story:
You’re a gatekeeper guarding a magical portal. The portal only opens if the user enters a number between 1 and 10. Use a do...while loop to keep asking until the user provides a valid input.
Instructions:
Write a function getValidInput() that repeatedly asks the user for a number between 1 and 10 using prompt(). The function should only stop when a valid input is given.
Example:
getValidInput(); // Keeps asking until a number between 1 and 10 is entered
 -->

 <!-- Hard tasks
Task 1: FizzBuzz with a Twist
Story:
You’re a wizard participating in a magical tournament. The tournament rules are based on the FizzBuzz game, but with a twist! Use loops to print numbers from 1 to 50 with special rules.
Instructions:
Write a function fizzBuzzTwist() that prints numbers from 1 to 50 with the following rules:
If the number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz".
If the number is divisible by 5, print "Buzz".
If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".
If the number contains the digit 3 (e.g., 13, 23), print "Almost Fizz".
Example:
fizzBuzzTwist(); // Output: 1, 2, Almost Fizz, 4, FizzBuzz, ..., 49, Buzz
 -->



 <!-- 
Task 2: Nested Loops: Multiplication Table
Story:
You’re a math wizard creating a magical multiplication table for your spellbook. Use nested for loops to generate the table up to n.
Instructions:
Write a function printMultiplicationTable(n) that prints the multiplication table up to n using nested for loops.
Example:
printMultiplicationTable(5); // Output: 1x1=1, 1x2=2, ..., 5x5=25
 -->

 <!-- Task 3: Modify Array While Looping
Story:
You’re a time traveler fixing a corrupted timeline. The timeline is represented as an array with duplicate events. Use loops to remove duplicates and restore the timeline.
Instructions:
Write a function removeDuplicates(arr) that removes duplicate elements from an array while looping through it. Be careful not to skip elements!
Example:
removeDuplicates([1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
