The console shows exactly:
 Route: West -->

 <!-- Quest 40 – Delegate Alert Handlers
 Difficulty: Medium (3 pts)
Story
 Multiple buttons trigger the same grid alert. You must avoid duplicate code by using a callback.
Objective
 Attach event listeners via a shared handler function.
Instructions
Name your file quest40.js


Assume an HTML page with buttons having class alert-btn


Declare a function handleAlert that prints exactly Alert triggered


Select all alert-btn elements into a list


Loop over the list and attach click listeners that call handleAlert


Acceptance Criteria
handleAlert logs “Alert triggered”


All buttons with class alert-btn use the same handler


Clicking any alert-btn prints exactly:
 Alert triggered
 -->

 <!-- Quest 39 – Merge Sector Data
 Difficulty: Medium (3 pts)
Story
 Sector reports arrive as separate objects. You must combine them into one unified report.
Objective
 Use object methods and template literals to merge data and display a summary.
Instructions
Name your file quest39.js

Create two constants:

dataA = { sector: 'X', load: 70 }

dataB = { uptime: '99%', status: 'online' }

Use Object.assign to merge dataA and dataB into combinedData

Create a constant summaryText using a template literal:
 Sector X – load 70%, uptime 99%, status online


Print the exact sentence
 Report: Sector X – load 70%, uptime 99%, status online


Acceptance Criteria
dataA and dataB match the specified objects


combinedData has all four properties


summaryText matches “Sector X – load 70%, uptime 99%, status online”


The console shows exactly:
 Report: Sector X – load 70%, uptime 99%, status online -->


 <!-- Quest 36 – Delayed Node Pings
 Difficulty: Medium (3 pts)
Story
 To avoid overload, node pings must occur one at a time with a delay.
Objective
 Use an async loop to ping each node name with a one-second pause between pings.
Instructions
Name your file quest36.js


Declare an async function pingNodes that:


Defines an array nodes with the texts core, grid, relay


For each node in nodes (for…of loop):


Await a promise that resolves after 1 second


Print the exact sentence
 Pinging: <node>


Call pingNodes at the end of the file


Acceptance Criteria
pingNodes logs exactly in order:
 Pinging: core
 Pinging: grid
 Pinging: relay


There is a one-second delay between each log

 <!-- Quest H2 – Diagnostic Sweep
 Difficulty: Hard (5 pts)

Story
 Critical node stats arrive as an object. You must compute the overall health score to advise engineers.
Objective
 Write a function that reads an object’s numeric values, averages them, and reports the result.

Instructions
Name your file questH2.js


Create a constant named diagnostics and assign it an object with properties cpu: 80, memory: 70, disk: 90


Declare a function named calcAverage that takes one parameter stats and uses a for…in loop to sum all values in stats, divides by the number of keys, and returns the result

Acceptance Criteria
diagnostics is defined as a constant object with cpu 80, memory 70, disk 90


calcAverage correctly loops over stats and returns 80


avgHealth holds the value 80

Create a constant values = [10, 20, 5, 30]


Declare createLogger(threshold = 15) that:


Declares logValues() which loops over values and for each number > threshold, prints Warning: <number>


Returns logValues

<!-- Quest H3 – Critical Sector Finder
 Difficulty: Hard (5 pts)

Story
 You need to pinpoint the sector under highest load to prevent outages.

Objective
 Use array methods and a reduce callback to find which sector has the maximum load.

Instructions
Name your file questH3.js


Create a constant named sectors and assign it an array of objects:
 • name: 'X', load: 20
 • name: 'Y', load: 50
 • name: 'Z', load: 40


Use the array reduce method with an arrow function to find the object with the highest load and store it in a constant named critical


Use a template literal and console.log to print exactly
 Critical sector: Y with load 50


Acceptance Criteria
sectors is defined as a constant array with the three specified objects


reduce returns the object for sector Y
