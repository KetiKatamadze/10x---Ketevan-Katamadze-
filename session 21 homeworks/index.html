 <!-- Exercise 9: The Haunted House Mystery
Story: A group of friends cautiously enters a small haunted house with just two rooms: the Kitchen and the Living Room. They want to quickly check if both rooms are clear of ghosts to know if the house is safe to proceed further.
Instructions:
Declare boolean variables for two rooms:


kitchenHasGhost - Set it to true if there's a ghost in the kitchen, or false if it's clear. Let's start by setting it to true for this example. (e.g., true)
livingRoomHasGhost - Set it to true or false for the living room. Let's set it to false for this example. (e.g., false)
Determine if the house is safe:


The house is considered safe only if both the kitchen AND the living room are clear of ghosts (meaning both kitchenHasGhost and livingRoomHasGhost are false).
Use the logical AND operator (&&) to check if both kitchenHasGhost is false and livingRoomHasGhost is false.
Store the safety result in a variable:


Store the result of your logical AND operation (which will be true or false) in a variable called isHouseSafe.
Print a message indicating if the house is safe:


Use an if/else statement based on the value of isHouseSafe:
If isHouseSafe is true, print: "The house is safe! No ghosts in the Kitchen or Living Room."
Else (if isHouseSafe is false), print: "Danger! The house is NOT safe. Ghosts detected!"

Declare a variable for the dragon's starting health:


dragonHealth - Set it to a starting number like 100.
Declare a variable for the knight's attack damage:


knightAttackDamage - Set it to a number representing the damage, like 25.
Reduce the dragon's health:


Use the -= operator to subtract the knightAttackDamage from the dragonHealth. (e.g., dragonHealth -= knightAttackDamage;)
Print the dragon's remaining health:


Use console.log() to display the dragonHealth after the attack. Label it clearly so it's easy to understand. For example: "Dragon's Health After Attack: [health value]". Use a template literal to include the dragonHealth in the message.
  -->


<!-- Exercise 12: The Speeding Race Car
Story: A race car driver is on the track, starting slow and then speeding up. We need to check if they exceed the speed limit after speeding up.

Instructions:
Declare a variable for the speed limit:


speedLimit - set it to a number like 50 (representing 50 mph, km/h, etc.).
Declare a variable for the car's initial speed:


carSpeed - set it to a number lower than the speed limit, like 30.
Increase the car's speed:


Use the += operator to increase carSpeed by a set amount, for example, increase it by 25. (e.g., carSpeed += 25;)
Check if the car's speed exceeds the speed limit:


Use an if statement to compare carSpeed with speedLimit. Check if carSpeed is greater than speedLimit.
Print a warning or an "okay" message:


If the carSpeed is greater than speedLimit, print a simple warning message to the console like: "Speed Warning: You are going too fast!".
Else (if the speed is not over the limit), print a message like: "Speed is okay."
Always print the current car speed:


After checking the speed limit, print the final carSpeed to the console, so we can see the car's speed. Label it clearly, like: "Current Speed: [speed value]". Use a template literal to include the carSpeed value in the message.

 <!-- Exercise 13: The Superhero Strength Test
Story: A classic showdown! Superhero "Valiant" and the notorious villain "Malakor" are testing their strength. We need to determine not just who is stronger, but by how much and announce the results with appropriate flair!
Instructions:
Declare Variables for Strength Levels:


heroStrength: Set to a number representing Valiant's strength (e.g., 95).
villainStrength: Set to a number representing Malakor's strength (e.g., 90).
Introduce Strength Difference Categories:


We'll categorize the strength difference to provide more detailed outcomes:
"Decisive Victory": If one character's strength is greater than the other by more than 10 points.
"Close Call": If one character's strength is greater by 10 points or less.
"Stalemate": If their strength levels are exactly equal.
Compare Strength Levels and Determine the Outcome:


Use if, else if, and else statements along with comparison operators (>, <, >=, <=, ===) to determine the outcome of the strength test based on the categories defined in step 2.
Consider these comparisons:
Is heroStrength greater than villainStrength by more than 10? (Decisive Hero Victory?)
Is villainStrength greater than heroStrength by more than 10? (Decisive Villain Victory?)
Is heroStrength exactly equal to villainStrength? (Stalemate?)
If none of the above are decisively true, then it's a "Close Call". You'll need to figure out in the "else" or "else if" branches who is slightly stronger in a close call scenario.
Print Descriptive Output Messages:


Use console.log() and template literals to print messages that reflect the determined outcome with a bit of story-like flair. 
For example:
For a Decisive Hero Victory: "Valiant triumphs decisively! Malakor is utterly outmatched!"
For a Decisive Villain Victory: "Malakor's power is overwhelming! Valiant is soundly defeated!"
For a Stalemate: "It's a strength stalemate! Neither Valiant nor Malakor can overpower the other."
For a Close Call Hero Victory: "Valiant barely edges out! A close call victory against Malakor!"
For a Close Call Villain Victory: "Malakor narrowly prevails! A hard-fought win over Valiant!"

<!-- Exercise 14: The Tricky Treasure Hunt
Story: An intrepid adventurer, Alex, is on a quest for a legendary hidden treasure. Finding it isn't just about having a clue, but having the right combination of clues. Let's help determine if Alex has enough to succeed!
Instructions:
Declare Boolean Variables for Multiple Clues:


hasTreasureMap: Does Alex possess an ancient treasure map? (e.g., true)
foundAncientKey: Has Alex discovered an ancient key? (e.g., false)
solvedRiddleScroll: Did Alex successfully solve a riddle from a cryptic scroll? (e.g., true)
hasCompass: Does Alex have a reliable compass? (e.g., true)
isFullMoon: Is it currently a full moon, as mentioned in legends? (e.g., false)
Define the Condition for Finding the Treasure:


To find the treasure, Alex needs to meet a combination of conditions. Here’s the tricky rule: Alex can find the treasure if they have both:


The Treasure Map AND
EITHER (The Ancient Key OR (Solved the Riddle Scroll AND Has a Compass))
Let's break down this condition:


Core Requirement: They must have the hasTreasureMap.
Alternative Paths: To proceed beyond the map, they need at least one of these:
foundAncientKey is enough by itself.
If they don't have the key, they must have both solvedRiddleScroll and hasCompass.
Use Logical Operators to Determine Success:


Write a JavaScript expression using the boolean variables and logical operators (&&, ||, !) to represent the combined condition described in step 2.
Store the result of this expression (which will be true or false) in a variable called canFindTreasure.
Print the Outcome:


Use an if/else statement based on the value of canFindTreasure to print a message to the console:
If canFindTreasure is true, print: "Success! Alex can find the legendary treasure!"
If canFindTreasure is false, print: "Alas, Alex is missing crucial clues and cannot find the treasure yet."

 <!-- Exercise 15: The Ice Cream Shop’s Daily Sales with Volume Discount
Story: "Scoops & Smiles" ice cream shop wants to calculate their daily earnings for cones and sundaes. They also want to implement a simple volume discount to encourage larger purchases!
Instructions:
Define Prices for Ice Cream Items:


"Ice Cream Cone": $4.00
"Ice Cream Sundae": $8.00
Store Daily Sales Data:


Declare variables to store the number of each item sold today:
conesSoldToday = (e.g., 250)
sundaesSoldToday = (e.g., 120)
Implement a Volume Discount:


"Scoops & Smiles" offers a 5% discount on the entire daily earnings if the total earnings before discount are $1000 or more.
Calculate Total Earnings:


Calculate the earnings from cones sales (cone price * cones sold).
Calculate the earnings from sundaes sales (sundae price * sundaes sold).
Calculate the total daily earnings before any discount by adding cone earnings and sundae earnings.
Check for discount: Use an if statement to check if the total daily earnings (before discount) are greater than or equal to $1000.
Apply discount if applicable: If the condition is true, calculate the 5% discount amount and subtract it from the total earnings to get the final daily earnings. (Hint: A 5% discount means you keep 95% of the original price. You can multiply by 0.95).
If the discount does not apply, then the final daily earnings are the same as the total earnings before discount.
Log the Results:


Use template literals to display the following in the console:
Total earnings before discount.
The amount of discount applied (if any, otherwise log $0).
Final total daily earnings after discount (or with no discount applied).
A message indicating if a volume discount was applied (e.g., "Volume Discount Applied: Yes/No").

Comparison operators
Create two variables (a and b) and check if they are equal. Use both normal comparison (==) and strict comparison (===). Then print the result in the console. 
Logical Operators
Imagine you have two numbers. Check if both numbers are positive using && (AND) operator, and check if at least one number is positive using || (OR) operator. The && operator returns true only if both conditions are true, while the || operator returns true if at least one condition is true. 
If-else statement
Write a program that checks if a number is even or odd. If the number is even , print "Even" in the console. If the number is odd, print "Odd"
Data Types
Find out the type of different values in your code. Create variables with different types of data, such as a number (number), text (string), boolean (true/false), null, and undefined. Use the typeof operator to check their type. For example, typeof 42 returns "number", while typeof "Hello" returns "string"
Checking Data Type
Create a variable with a value. Then, use the isNaN() function to check if the value is a number or not. If the value is a number, print "This is a number" in the console. If it is not a number, print "This is not a number"

BMI is a calculated measure of a person's body weight (in kilograms) divided by the square of their height (in meters).
For example, if you weigh 70kg and are 1.70m tall, you work out your BMI by:
Squaring your height in metres: 1.70 × 1.70 = 2.89
Dividing your weight in kilograms: 70 ÷ 2.89 = 24.22
A person enters their weight and height, store them in variables.
 Create a function that calculates their BMI and tells them which range they are in:
Under 18.5 – This is described as underweight.
Between 18.5 and 24.9 – This is described as the ‘healthy range’.
Between 25 and 29.9 – This is described as overweight.
Between 30 and 39.9 – This is described as obesity.
40 or over – This is described as severe obesity. -->
